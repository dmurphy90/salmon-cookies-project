          <h4>Worth The Wait!</h4>
          <p>"Every time I've ever gone to Pats it's been close to a half hour wait just order every time. Who would wait that long for cookies made from salmon? A SMART PERSON IS WHO!! These cookies are nothing like you've ever tasted, flavor profiles you've never experienced. You're reminded of rushing rapids and Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory all at the same time. All of this AND gluten free?! Sign me up as a regular."  - Bill Gates</p>
          <h5>A Game Changer</h5>
          <p>"When I first heard cookies were being made from Salmon I thought...just no. But now it's like I can't even look at a cookie without it being fish based now! Your grandmother has the best chocolate chip cookies you say? How much trout does she use in them? If the answer is none then don't waste my time, just bring me some Pat's Salmon Cookies!" - Russell Wilson
